# Overview

This is a python wrapper for the Bandcamp API (http://bandcamptech.wordpress.com/2010/05/15/bandcamp-api/), I have based the model after the python-twitter project, so props to those guys.

Current capabilities:

* 100% implementation of all API calls
* All calls mapped to python objects
* Able to cache calls

Still needed:

* Full Documentation
* Unit Tests
